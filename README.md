# INKLUSIVA Call

INKLUSIVA Call is a friendly [Jitsi](https://github.com/jitsi|Jitsi) Fork which enables accessible video meetings on the internet. 

It is GDPR-compliant and very data-efficient. The software was developed together with and for people with disabilities and those active in self-help groups. The INKLUSIVA Call project is implemented by LAG Selbsthilfe Rheinland-Pfalz and funded by Aktion Mensch.

INKLUSIVA Call was developed for:

* People with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses
* Self-help and self-advocacy organizations
* Organizations that want to use the application for inclusive events, meetings, and services (inclusive meetings).

Amongst the features you may know from jitsi here are the main features INKLUSIVA-Call offers:
### Accessibility Features
The goal of INKLUSIVA Call is to enable barrier-free video meetings. The functions of INKLUSIVA Call are designed for accessibility. They were developed or reviewed in focus groups. These focus groups bring together people with disabilities or impairments. The following and other features have been developed:

### Settings for Hearing, Vision, Interpretation, and Emergencies
In INKLUSIVA Call, settings can be configured for hearing, vision, assistance, and emergencies. The participation of interpreters is supported, and there is automatic captioning.

### Savable Meeting Settings
In INKLUSIVA Call, users can save their own meeting settings: in the browser or as a downloadable file. We, as operators, do not store this data.

### Settings for Vision and Hearing
INKLUSIVA Call allows precise settings in the areas of hearing and vision. For example, video tiles can be darkened or brightened. Or quiet sounds can be amplified.

### Sign Language and Text Interpretation
INKLUSIVA Call supports the participation of text interpreters. The display of sign language interpreters can be individually adjusted. Automatic captioning can also be activated.

### Emergency Settings
In INKLUSIVA Call, users can set up emergency settings. For example, dimming all videos. If an emergency occurs, these settings can be activated with one click.

### Configure Settings in the Accessibility Assistant
Personal settings for INKLUSIVA Call can be determined before joining a meeting, depending on which functions the user needs. For this, there is the so-called Accessibility Assistant. This is a form that asks for the desired settings.
* Settings can be changed at any time during the meeting.
* Settings can be saved in the web browser or downloaded as a file.
* The next time INKLUSIVA Call is used, the file with the settings can be uploaded again. Then the settings will be restored.
* The Accessibility Assistant can also be skipped. In this case, standard settings are active.
